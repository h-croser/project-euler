# Project Euler Entries
## Hamish Croser
The folders in this repository contain my entries to the Project Euler problems. The problems can be found here: https://projecteuler.net/
Entries are written in Python.
Each problem has a file named after the problem number such that problem 1 has a folder named \#1
Each folder contains the files related to the entry with at least one file named after the problem so that problem
1 has a file named p1.py

p.py is a template for the entry files.
